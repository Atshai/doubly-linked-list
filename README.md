# doubly-linked-list
This C program implements a doubly linked list with functions to insert nodes at the end (`insert`), at the beginning (`insertbeg`), after a given node (`insertafter`), before a given node (`insertbefore`), and at a specific position (`insertpos`). It also includes a `display` function to print the list.
